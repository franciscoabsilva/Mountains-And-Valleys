#Mountains and Valleys
Mid term project for Programming Foundations

##Introduction
This project aims to simulate a mountainous territory with an ecosystem of mountains and valleys. The program models a territory made up of intersections formed by vertical and horizontal paths, where each intersection can either be occupied by a mountain (represented as an obstacle) or be free (representing an open area). The goal of the simulation is to identify and analyze mountain chains and valleys within this territory.
